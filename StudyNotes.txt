Day 1

pom.xml - "build brain" defines (Java version, Dependencies, and Plugins)
Application.java - known as entry point and the component scan root (All packages should live under this package)
controller/ - HTTP boundary which handles (Requests, Responses, and Validation), doesn't talk to database directly 
service/ - business logic which handles (Rules, Decisions, Transactions)
repository/ - database access which handles (SQL,Fetching/saving data)
domain/-the data model which contains (JPA entities and Enums)
dto/ - API contracts which is used for Request and Response payloads (NEVER EXPOSE ENTITIES DIRECTLY IN APIs)
security/ - which contains (Security config, JWT filters, and Role handling)
config/ - which contains (Beans and App configuration)
exception/ - which contains (custom exceptions and global error handlers)
util/ - which contains (small helper classes)
resources/ folder - which contains application.yml(Config, Profiles[dev/test/prod]),
		    db/migration/ (Flyway SQL scripts and Versioned schema changes)
test/ - mirrors main/ files (Same package structure = easier testing)

Important rules to memorize 
*Controllers = HTTP only
*Services = logic + transactions
*Repositories = data access
*DTOs does not equal to entities
*Config does not equal to Logic
*Security is explicit 
*Everything lives under Application package
		    
@RestController - is an annotation that marks a Java class as a REST API controller. Here is what it does:
1.Identifies the class as a controller
2.Automatically serializes return values to JSON/XML

DTOs define API boundaries


Day 2

Controller maps HTTP -> DTO -> service -> DTO -> response

Why an HTTP folder?
-Keeps manual API tests separate from code
-Mirrors what real teams do
-Easy to version control
-clean root directory

src/main -> production code
src/tests -> automated tests
http/ -> manual API testing
README.md -> humans
NOTES.md -> learning + reference

REST controller basics
-@RestController maps HTTP Requests to Java methods
-@RequestMapping("/api/v1") defines a base path
-@GetMapping handles GET requests
-@PostMapping handles POST requests

DTOs (Data Transfer Object)
-DTOs define API contracts
-Separate request DTOs from response DTOs
-Never expose entities directly
-DTO field names must match JSON keys

Request body handling
-@RequestBody binds JSON to a java object
-Content-Type: application/json is required
-Missing or malformed JSON results in 400 Bad Request

Common HTTP Status meanings
-200 OK - success
-400 Bad Request - invalid input
-404 Not Found - path or method mismatch
-415 Unsupported media type - wrong Content-Type

Manual API testing tools
Postman
-Best for quick manual testing
-Requires correct method, URL, headers, and body 
-Hidden characters (e.g. %0A) can cause 404 errors
VS Code REST Client
-.http files stored in project root (http/ folder)
-Requests executed with "Send Request"
-Used as manual smoke tests
-Not automated tests
REST Client file structure
http -> api.http
