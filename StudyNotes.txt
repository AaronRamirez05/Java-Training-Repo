pom.xml - "build brain" defines (Java version, Dependencies, and Plugins)
Application.java - known as entry point and the component scan root (All packages should live under this package)
controller/ - HTTP boundary which handles (Requests, Responses, and Validation), doesn't talk to database directly 
service/ - business logic which handles (Rules, Decisions, Transactions)
repository/ - database access which handles (SQL,Fetching/saving data)
domain/-the data model which contains (JPA entities and Enums)
dto/ - API contracts which is used for Request and Response payloads (NEVER EXPOSE ENTITIES DIRECTLY IN APIs)
security/ - which contains (Security config, JWT filters, and Role handling)
config/ - which contains (Beans and App configuration)
exception/ - which contains (custom exceptions and global error handlers)
util/ - which contains (small helper classes)
resources/ folder - which contains application.yml(Config, Profiles[dev/test/prod]),
		    db/migration/ (Flyway SQL scripts and Versioned schema changes)
test/ - mirrors main/ files (Same package structure = easier testing)

Important rules to memorize 
*Controllers = HTTP only
*Services = logic + transactions
*Repositories = data access
*DTOs does not equal to entities
*Config does not equal to Logic
*Security is explicit 
*Everything lives under Application package
